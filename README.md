AWS Cloud Projects README


Introduction
This repository contains various AWS cloud projects that demonstrate different aspects of cloud computing using AWS Lambda, EC2, and other services. Each project includes detailed instructions and sample code to help you understand and implement the solutions. The projects are designed to be production-ready, showcasing real-world applications and best practices for deploying robust solutions on AWS.

Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have the following:
An AWS account
AWS CLI installed and configured
Basic knowledge of AWS services
Git installed on your local machine

Project List
Project 1: Image Processing with OpenCV on Lambda
Description: This project shows how to leverage OpenCV, a powerful image processing library, within AWS Lambda to perform complex image processing tasks. The Lambda function is triggered by S3 events, processes the images using OpenCV, and stores the results back in S3.

Technologies Used: Lambda, OpenCV, S3, IAM

Use Case: Automated image processing pipeline for applications such as photo editing, image analysis, or content moderation.


Project 2: Lambda with EC2 Stop/Start
Description: This project illustrates how AWS Lambda can be used to start and stop EC2 instances based on certain triggers or schedules. This can help in cost optimization by ensuring that instances are running only when needed.

Technologies Used: Lambda, EC2, CloudWatch Events, IAM

Use Case: Cost optimization for development or testing environments by scheduling EC2 instances to run only during business hours.


Project 3: Lambda EBS Volume Modification
Description: This project demonstrates how to use AWS Lambda to automate the modification of EBS volumes, such as resizing volumes or changing their types. The Lambda function can be triggered based on CloudWatch Events or other AWS services.

Technologies Used: Lambda, EC2, EBS, IAM

Use Case: Dynamic storage management for applications with varying storage requirements, such as data lakes or content management systems.
